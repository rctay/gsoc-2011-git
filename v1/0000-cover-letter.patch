Subject: [RFC/PATCH 0/3] teach --histogram to diff

(Shawn, I was held up with the patch messages, sorry for the delay.)

Port JGit's HistogramDiff(Index) over to C. This algorithm extends the
patience algorithm to "support low-occurrence common elements" [1].

Rough numbers show that it is a faster alternative to its --patience
cousin, as well as to the default Meyers algorithm:

  $ time ./git log --histogram -p v1.0.0 >/dev/null
  
  real    0m12.998s
  user    0m11.506s
  sys     0m1.487s
  $ time ./git log -p v1.0.0 >/dev/null
  
  real    0m13.575s
  user    0m12.101s
  sys     0m1.468s
  $ time ./git log --patience -p v1.0.0 >/dev/null
  
  real    0m14.978s
  user    0m13.508s
  sys     0m1.464s

The first patch implements JGit's HistogramDiff(Index) proper. The
second and third patches aren't essential but yield performance gains.

Note: these patches must be applied on top of rc/histogram-diff in pu.
