+compat: add memrchr()
+
+Reimplement another handy convenience function from glibc.  memrchr()
+searches from the end of a memory area for a particular character.  It
+is similar to strrchr() but takes a length argument and is
+binary-safe.
+
+The whole-directory rename detection patch could use this to find the
+last '/' in a (possibly truncated) pathname.
+
+The system memrchr() is used on glibc systems to provide a sanity
+check that our code works with a non-custom implementation.  Yes, the
+various BSDs have their own highly optimized memrchr(), too.  The
+planned use of memrchr in git is for clarity, not speed, so it is not
+obvious that the makefile+autoconf magic to use libc's implementation
+on a wide variety of operating systems would be worth the time.
