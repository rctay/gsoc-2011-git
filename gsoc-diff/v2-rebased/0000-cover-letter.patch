Subject: [PATCH 0/4] changes for rc/histogram-diff in 'next'

This is a rebased version of this series:

  [PATCH v2 0/8] teach --histogram to diff
  <1312168608-10828-1-git-send-email-rctay89@gmail.com>

I had overlooked that the previous iteration of the series has been
added to 'next'.

Contents:
[PATCH 1/4] xdiff: do away with xdl_mmfile_next()
[PATCH 2/4] xdiff/xhistogram: rework handling of recursed results
[PATCH 3/4] xdiff/xhistogram: rely on xdl_trim_ends()
[PATCH 4/4] xdiff/xhistogram: drop need for additional variable
