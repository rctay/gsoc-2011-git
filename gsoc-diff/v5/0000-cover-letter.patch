Subject: [PATCH v2 0/8] teach --histogram to diff

Port JGit's HistogramDiff(Index) over to C. This algorithm extends the
patience algorithm to "support low-occurrence common elements" [1].
Rough numbers show that it is a faster alternative to its --patience
cousin, as well as to the default Meyers algorithm.

Changed from v1/RFC:
 - patch #2 is new
 - patch #6 been changed
 - all other patches are unchanged

Contents:
[PATCH v2 1/8] xdiff/xprepare: use memset()
[PATCH v2 2/8] do away with xdl_mmfile_next()
[PATCH v2 3/8] xdiff/xprepare: refactor abort cleanups
[PATCH v2 4/8] xdiff/xpatience: factor out fall-back-diff function
[PATCH v2 5/8] t4033-diff-patience: factor out tests
[PATCH v2 6/8] teach --histogram to diff
[PATCH v2 7/8] xdiff/xprepare: skip classification
[PATCH v2 8/8] xdiff/xprepare: use a smaller sample size for histogram diff
